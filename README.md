[ACM MM'24] DINO is Also a Semantic Guider: Exploiting Class-aware Affinity for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation

---
**Code repository is still under construction.**

Due to some unforeseen circumstances for me, the building process has been postponed. I am working to solve them as quickly as possible and will complete the repository soon :)

The training code is nealy completed and the core component of DINO is released at `modules/label_from_dino.py`.
